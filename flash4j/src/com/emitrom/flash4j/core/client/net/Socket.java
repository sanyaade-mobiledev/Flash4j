/**
 * The Socket class enables code to establish Transport Control Protocol (TCP)
 * socket connections for sending and receiving binary data. The Socket class is
 * useful for working with servers that use binary protocols.
 * <p>
 * To use the methods of the Socket class, first use the constructor, new
 * Socket, to create a Socket object.
 * <p>
 * A socket transmits and receives data asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * On some operating systems, flush() is called automatically between execution
 * frames, but on other operating systems, such as Windows, the data is never
 * sent unless you call flush() explicitly. To ensure your application behaves
 * reliably across all operating systems, it is a good practice to call the
 * flush() method after writing each message (or related group of data) to the
 * socket.
 * <p>
 * In Adobe AIR, Socket objects are also created when a listening ServerSocket
 * receives a connection from an external process. The Socket representing the
 * connection is dispatched in a ServerSocketConnectEvent. Your application is
 * responsible for maintaining a reference to this Socket object. If you don't,
 * the Socket object is eligible for garbage collection and may be destroyed by
 * the runtime without warning.
 * <p>
 * SWF content running in the local-with-filesystem security sandbox cannot use
 * sockets.
 * <p>
 * Socket policy files on the target host specify the hosts from which SWF files
 * can make socket connections, and the ports to which those connections can be
 * made. The security requirements with regard to socket policy files have
 * become more stringent in the last several releases of FlashDetect Player. In all
 * versions of FlashDetect Player, Adobe recommends the use of a socket policy file;
 * in some circumstances, a socket policy file is required. Therefore, if you
 * are using Socket objects, make sure that the target host provides a socket
 * policy file if necessary.

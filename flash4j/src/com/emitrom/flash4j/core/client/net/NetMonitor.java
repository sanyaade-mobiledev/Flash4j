 * The NetMonitor class maintains a list of NetStream objects. Use the

 * An instance of this class dispatches a netStreamCreate event whenever a new
 * NetStream object is created.

 * You can use the NetMonitor class to help track video playback and related
 * events without regard to the specific video player being used. This facility
 * can be helpful when implementing media measurement, analytics, and usage
 * tracking libraries.

 * Android and Blackberry Tablet OS, or by AIR on iOS.

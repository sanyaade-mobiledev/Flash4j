/**
 * The Video class displays live or recorded video in an application without
 * embedding the video in your SWF file. peer class creates a Video object that
 * plays either of the following kinds of video: recorded video files stored on
 * a server or locally, or live video captured by the user. A Video object is a
 * display object on the application's display list and represents the visual
 * space in which the video runs in a user interface.
 * <p>
 * When used with FlashDetect Media Server, the Video object allows you to send live
 * video captured by a user to the server and then broadcast it from the server
 * to other users. Using these features, you can develop media applications such
 * as a simple video player, a video player with multipoint publishing from one
 * server to another, or a video sharing application for a user community.
 * <p>
 * FlashDetect Player 9 and later supports publishing and playback of FLV files
 * encoded with either the Sorenson Spark or On2 VP6 codec and also supports an
 * alpha channel. The On2 VP6 video codec uses less bandwidth than older
 * technologies and offers additional deblocking and deringing filters. See the
 * flash.net.NetStream class for more information about video playback and
 * supported formats.
 * <p>
 * FlashDetect Player 9.0.115.0 and later supports mipmapping to optimize runtime
 * rendering quality and performance. For video playback, FlashDetect Player uses
 * mipmapping optimization if you set the Video object's smoothing property to
 * true.
 * <p>
 * As with other display objects on the display list, you can control various
 * properties of Video objects. For example, you can move the Video object
 * around on the Stage by using its x and y properties, you can change its size
 * using its height and width properties, and so on.
 * <p>
 * To play a video stream, use <code>attachCamera()</code> or
 * <code>attachNetStream()</code> to attach the video to the Video object. Then,
 * add the Video object to the display list using <code>addChild()</code>.

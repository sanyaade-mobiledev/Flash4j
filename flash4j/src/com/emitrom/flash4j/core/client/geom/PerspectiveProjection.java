/**
 * The PerspectiveProjection class provides an easy way to assign or modify the
 * perspective transformations of a display object and all of its children. For
 * more complex or custom perspective transformations, use the Matrix3D class.
 * While the PerspectiveProjection class provides basic three-dimensional
 * presentation properties, the Matrix3D class provides more detailed control
 * over the three-dimensional presentation of display objects.
 * <p>
 * Projection is a way of representing a three-dimensional object in a
 * two-dimensional space, like a cube projected onto a computer screen.
 * Perspective projection uses a viewing frustum (a rectangular pyramid) to
 * model and project a three-dimensional world and its objects on the screen.
 * The viewing frustum becomes increasingly wider as it moves further from the
 * origin of the viewpoint. The origin of the viewpoint could be a camera or the
 * eyes of an observer facing the screen. The projected perspective produces the
 * illusion of three dimensions with depth and distance, where the objects
 * closer to the screen appear larger than the objects farther from the screen.

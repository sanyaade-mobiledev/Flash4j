/**
 * The Matrix3D class represents a transformation matrix that determines the
 * position and orientation of a three-dimensional (3D) display object. The
 * matrix can perform transformation functions including translation
 * (repositioning along the x, y, and z axes), rotation, and scaling (resizing).
 * The Matrix3D class can also perform perspective projection, which maps points
 * from the 3D coordinate space to a two-dimensional (2D) view.
 * <p>
 * A single matrix can combine multiple transformations and apply them at once
 * to a 3D display object. For example, a matrix can be applied to 3D
 * coordinates to perform a rotation followed by a translation.
 * <p>
 * When you explicitly set the z property or any of the rotation or scaling
 * properties of a display object, a corresponding Matrix3D object is
 * automatically created.
 * 
 * You can access a 3D display object's Matrix3D object through the
 * transform.matrix3d property. 2D objects do not have a Matrix3D object.
 * <p>
 * The value of the z property of a 2D object is zero and the value of its
 * matrix3D property is null.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> If the same Matrix3D object is assigned to two different display
 * objects, a runtime error is thrown.

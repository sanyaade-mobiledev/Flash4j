/**
 * This class is used to create lightweight shapes using the ActionScript
 * drawing application program interface (API). The Shape class includes a
 * graphics property, which lets you access methods from the Graphics class.
 * <p>
 * The Sprite class also includes a graphicsproperty, and it includes other
 * features not available to the Shape class. For example, a Sprite object is a
 * display object container, whereas a Shape object is not (and cannot contain
 * child display objects). For this reason, Shape objects consume less memory
 * than Sprite objects that contain the same graphics. However, a Sprite object
 * supports user input events, while a Shape object does not.
